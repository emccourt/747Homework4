SPEC AG (traffic_light_NS = GREEN & traffic_light_EW = GREEN); --anti-property

Tracece Description: CTL Counterexample 
Trace Type: Counterexample 
  -> State: 1.1 <-
    traffic_light_NS = GREEN
    traffic_light_EW = RED
    ped_light_NS = WALK
    ped_light_EW = WAIT
    button_NS = RESET
    button_EW = RESET
    traffic_sensor_NS = EMPTY
    traffic_sensor_EW = EMPTY
    emergency_sensor_NS = FALSE
    emergency_sensor_EW = FALSE

Our counter example is to show that it is not possible in all executions to have both traffic lights green
The simpliest counter example is the initial set of staes where both lights are not green
